                    As a passionate MERN stack developer, UI/UX designer, and a lifelong artist, I bring ideas to life through a seamless fusion of clean code, compelling design, and visual storytelling. My expertise lies in crafting responsive, high-performance web applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, while ensuring every interface is intuitive, aesthetic, and user-centric. I design thoughtful user experiences using tools like Figma, Sketch, and Adobe XD, focusing on wireframes, prototypes, and user flows. With a problem-solving mindset, I approach challenges with creativity and logic â€” building smart, scalable solutions that deliver both function and delight.
